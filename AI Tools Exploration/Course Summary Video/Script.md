## Title
My Journey Through Artificial Intelligence

## Script

Hi, Iâ€™m Srabonti Suchi Talukdar, a Computer Science & Engineering student at North East University Bangladesh.

Over the past six months, I have explored the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence through my course CSE-412.

I implemented key algorithms such as A*, AO*, Minimax, and Alpha-Beta Pruning â€” each helping me understand how machines make intelligent decisions.

I also created AI-based games like Tic Tac Toe, Chess, and Rock Paper Scissors, applying search algorithms and decision-making logic to make them smart.

Using AI tools like Pictory and ChatGPT, I developed this video and crafted presentation materials to creatively express my learnings.

Guided by Razorshi Prozzwal Talukder, this course blended theory and practical work, making me confident in building intelligent applications.

This project reflects my passion and growth in Artificial Intelligence. Thank you for watching.
