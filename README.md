## 📘 Key Learnings & Implementations

Throughout the course, I explored and implemented several key concepts in AI:

### ✅ Algorithms Covered:
- **A\* (AO-star) Algorithm**
- **AO\* (AO-star) Algorithm**
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**
- **Beam Search**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Depth-Limited Search (DLS)**
- **Best-First Search**
- **Bidirectional Search**
- **Hill Climbing**
- **Minimax Algorithm**

These algorithms enhanced my understanding of AI search techniques, optimization, and decision-making logic.

### 🕹️ Game Projects:
- **Tic Tac Toe**
- **Chess**
- **Rock Paper Scissors**

Developing these games helped solidify the theoretical knowledge by transforming it into interactive applications.

## 🎞️ Multimedia Projects

As part of this course, I created the following using **free AI tools**:

- **🎥 1-Minute Course Video**:
  Created using [Pictory AI](https://pictory.ai/) to summarize key concepts and experiences in a visually engaging format.

- **🖼️ AI-Generated Presentation Slides**:
  Designed using [Sidesgo AI](https://sidesgo.com/) for the visual layout and **ChatGPT** for crafting the perfect slide texts — clean, concise, and well-structured.

> 📁 Detailed steps and tool usage are available in the [`AI Tools Exploration`](./AI%20Tools%20Exploration/) folder.
