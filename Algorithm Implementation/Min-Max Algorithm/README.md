# 🎲 Minimax Algorithm

This implementation demonstrates the **Minimax algorithm** — a decision rule used in two-player zero-sum games to find the optimal move by minimizing the possible loss in the worst-case scenario.

## 🚀 About This Algorithm

**Minimax** is a recursive strategy that simulates all possible moves in a game tree, assuming both players play optimally:

- **Maximizing player** tries to maximize the score.
- **Minimizing player** tries to minimize the score.
- Recursively evaluates the game tree from the current node down to terminal states (leaf nodes with numeric scores).
- Chooses the move that leads to the best guaranteed outcome assuming perfect play from both sides.
- Commonly used in games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Chess, and Checkers.

## 🧠 How the Algorithm Works

- Start at the **root node** representing the current game state.
- If the node is a **terminal node** (leaf), return its numeric value.
- Otherwise, recursively evaluate the **left** and **right** child nodes.
- If it’s the **maximizing player**’s turn, select the maximum of the child nodes' values.
- If it’s the **minimizing player**’s turn, select the minimum of the child nodes' values.
- Propagate this value up the tree until the root node's best move value is determined.

### 🪜 Steps:

1. Check if the current node is terminal. If yes, return its value.
2. Recursively apply Minimax to the left and right child nodes.
3. If maximizing player: return max of left and right child values.
4. If minimizing player: return min of left and right child values.
5. Repeat until the root node's best value is computed.
