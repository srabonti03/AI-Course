# 🌲 Depth-First Search (DFS) Traversal Algorithm

This implementation demonstrates the **Depth-First Search (DFS)** algorithm — a classic graph traversal technique that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking, ideal for exhaustive search and pathfinding in graphs.

## 🚀 About This Algorithm

**Depth-First Search** explores nodes by diving deep into each branch before moving to the next sibling node.

- Uses recursion or a **stack** data structure.
- Explores a path fully before backtracking.
- Useful for detecting cycles, connectivity, and topological sorting.
- Can be applied in solving puzzles, maze traversal, and pathfinding.

## 🧠 How the Algorithm Works

- Starts from a chosen **start** node.
- Marks nodes as visited to prevent cycles.
- Recursively explores unvisited neighbors **deeply**.
- Backtracks once no more unvisited neighbors are available.

### 🪜 Steps:

1. Begin at the **start node**.
2. Mark the current node as visited and process it.
3. For each unvisited neighbor, recursively apply DFS.
4. Continue until all reachable nodes are visited.
