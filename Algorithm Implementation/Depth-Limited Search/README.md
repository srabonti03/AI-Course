# 🌳 Depth-Limited Search (DLS) Algorithm

This implementation demonstrates the **Depth-Limited Search (DLS)** algorithm — a variation of DFS that explores paths deeply but only up to a fixed depth limit, preventing infinite descent in cyclic or infinite graphs.

## 🚀 About This Algorithm

**Depth-Limited Search** traverses nodes deeply like DFS but stops once a specified depth limit is reached.

- Uses recursion with a **depth cutoff**.
- Avoids searching beyond the given depth limit.
- Useful when the search space is large or infinite.
- Acts as a building block for **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)**.

## 🧠 How the Algorithm Works

- Starts from a start node with an initial depth of zero.
- Recursively explores neighbors, increasing depth by one each step.
- Stops recursion if the current depth exceeds the **limit**.
- If the goal is found within the limit, search ends successfully.
- Tracks if the limit is crossed without finding the goal.

---

### 🪜 Steps:

1. Begin at the **start node** with depth = 0.
2. If current node equals the goal, mark found and record path.
3. If depth exceeds the **limit**, stop recursion and note limit crossed.
4. Otherwise, recursively search each unvisited neighbor at **depth + 1**.
5. Continue until goal found or all paths within limit are explored.
