# 🔍 A* Search Algorithm in AND-OR Graphs

This project implements the **A\*** Search Algorithm to find an **optimal path** in a graph that includes both **AND** and **OR** relationships between nodes. The algorithm uses heuristics to determine the most promising path towards the goal node.

---

## 🧠 How the Algorithm Works

The A* algorithm is a **best-first search** technique that finds the **least-cost path** from a start node to a goal node by considering both:

- `g(n)`: Actual cost from the start node to the current node.
- `h(n)`: Heuristic estimated cost from the current node to the goal.

The total estimated cost `f(n)` is:

```text
f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
```
---

### 🪜 Steps:

1. Start from the initial node (`A`).
2. Add it to a **priority queue (min-heap)** using `f(n)` as the key.
3. Expand the node with the **lowest f(n)** value.
4. For each child:
   - Calculate the tentative cost `g(n)`.
   - If it’s lower than a previous path, update it and add to the queue.
5. Repeat until the **goal node** is found or the queue is empty.

### 📌 Special Case: AND-OR Relationships

- **OR Nodes**: Choose any one of the children.
  - Example: `A → B` **or** `A → C` **or** `A → D`
- **AND Nodes**: All children must be satisfied.
  - Example: `B → E` **and** `F` (both must be processed)

> **Note:** This implementation assumes **OR** semantics in traversal. A complete AND-OR graph solver would need additional logic for AND aggregation.
