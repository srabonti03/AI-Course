# 🧭 Breadth-First Search (BFS) Traversal Algorithm

This implementation demonstrates the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm — a classic graph traversal method that explores nodes level-by-level, making it ideal for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

---

## 🚀 About This Algorithm

**Breadth-First Search** begins at a root node and explores all neighboring nodes first, before moving on to the next level of neighbors.

- Uses a **queue** data structure.
- Explores nodes in the order they are discovered.
- Ideal for shortest path problems in unweighted graphs.
- Guarantees the shortest path (by edge count) in such graphs.

## 🧠 How the Algorithm Works

- Starts from a chosen **start** node.
- Uses a **queue** to keep track of discovered nodes.
- Marks **nodes as visited** to avoid repetition.
- Continues until all reachable nodes have been visited.

---

### 🪜 Steps:

1. Initialize a queue with the **start node**.
2. Repeat while the queue is not empty:
   - Remove the node at the front.
   - If not visited, mark it and process its neighbors.
   - Add all unvisited neighbors to the queue.
3. Continue until all reachable nodes are traversed.
